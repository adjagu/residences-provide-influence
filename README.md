# Residences Provide Influence

A collection of mods for Anno 1800 that add influence production to residence buildings which previously did not produce influence. Version [0.1.3](https://github.com/adjagu/residences-provide-influence/releases/tag/0.1.3) added support for [iModYourAnno](#imodyouranno) tweaking.
